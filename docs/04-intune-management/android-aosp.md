# Android AOSP Enrollment for Teams Rooms

## Overview

Starting in 2025, Android-based Microsoft Teams Rooms devices use Android Open Source Project (AOSP) enrollment in Microsoft Intune. This provides a standardized management experience for Android MTR devices.

## Understanding AOSP Enrollment

### What is AOSP?

AOSP enrollment is a device management mode for corporate-owned Android devices that don't require Google Mobile Services (GMS). It's designed for dedicated-use devices like kiosks and meeting room systems.

### Why AOSP for MTR?

- **Consistent management** across vendors
- **No Google dependency** for device management
- **Dedicated device mode** optimized for single-purpose use
- **Corporate-owned** device management model
- **Intune integration** for policies and compliance

## Prerequisites

### Requirements

- Microsoft Intune license
- Android device certified for Teams Rooms
- Device running compatible Android version
- Network connectivity during enrollment
- Enrollment token/QR code generated

### Supported Devices

Check with your vendor for AOSP support:
- Poly Studio X Series
- Logitech Rally Bar devices
- Yealink MeetingBar series
- Neat devices
- Other certified Android MTR devices

> **Note:** Not all Android MTR devices support AOSP enrollment. Verify with your vendor before purchase.

## Troubleshooting

### Enrollment Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| QR code won't scan | Camera issue or invalid code | Regenerate token/QR code |
| Token expired | Past expiration date | Create new enrollment profile |
| Network error | No connectivity | Verify Wi-Fi connection |
| Enrollment blocked | Platform restriction | Enable AOSP in Intune |

### Post-Enrollment Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Policies not applying | Sync delay | Force sync from device |
| Apps not installing | Deployment not assigned | Verify app assignments |
| Device noncompliant | Configuration drift | Review compliance details |

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check device enrollment:**
   - Navigate to Intune > Devices > Android
   - Search for device by serial number

2. **View device details:**
   - Check last sync time
   - Review compliance state
   - Verify assigned profiles

3. **Force sync:**
   - In Intune portal: Device > Sync
   - On device: Settings > Accounts > Work account > Sync

## Best Practices

1. **Create dedicated profiles** for MTR devices
2. **Test enrollment process** with pilot devices
3. **Document vendor-specific steps** for each device type
4. **Use QR codes** for faster enrollment
5. **Set appropriate token expiration** (not too short)
6. **Monitor enrollment status** in Intune dashboard
7. **Keep spare tokens** available for new devices
8. **Coordinate with vendors** for firmware requirements

## Migration from Legacy Enrollment

If migrating from older enrollment methods:

1. **Document current configuration**
2. **Create AOSP profiles** that match existing
3. **Test with pilot devices**
4. **Factory reset** and re-enroll devices
5. **Verify functionality** before production

> **Warning:** Factory reset is typically required when changing enrollment types. Plan for downtime.
