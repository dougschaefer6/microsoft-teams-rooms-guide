# Android MTR Deployment

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Microsoft Teams Rooms on Android devices. Android MTR devices are typically all-in-one video bars or modular systems from certified vendors.

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before beginning deployment, ensure:

- [ ] Resource account created and licensed
- [ ] Calendar processing configured
- [ ] Conditional Access policies updated
- [ ] Intune AOSP enrollment configured (if managing with Intune)
- [ ] Network connectivity verified
- [ ] Device certified for Teams Rooms
- [ ] Resource account credentials documented
- [ ] Vendor documentation reviewed

## Vendor-Specific Considerations

Each Android MTR vendor has unique setup processes. Consult vendor documentation for:

| Vendor | Documentation |
|--------|---------------|
| Poly | poly.com/support |
| Logitech | logitech.com/support |
| Yealink | yealink.com/support |
| Neat | neat.no/support |
| Jabra | jabra.com/support |
| Cisco | cisco.com/support |

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Unbox and Connect Hardware

1. **Unbox device components**
   - Main video bar/compute unit
   - Touch controller (if separate)
   - Cables and power supplies
   - Mounting hardware

2. **Mount devices**
   - Mount video bar below/above display
   - Position touch controller on table
   - Route cables cleanly

3. **Connect cables**
   - Display: HDMI from video bar to display
   - Network: Ethernet (recommended) or Wi-Fi
   - Touch controller: PoE or USB-C (vendor-dependent)
   - Power: Connect last

### Step 2: Initial Device Setup

1. **Power on device**
   - Main unit and touch controller
   - Wait for boot sequence

2. **Select language and region**
   - Follow on-screen prompts
   - Select appropriate region settings

3. **Connect to network**
   - **Ethernet**: Usually auto-detected
   - **Wi-Fi**: Select network and enter credentials

4. **Accept license agreements**
   - Microsoft and vendor EULAs

### Step 3: Firmware Update (If Required)

Many devices check for firmware updates during setup:

1. **Allow update check**
2. **Install updates if available**
   - May take 10-30 minutes
   - Device will restart

> **Tip:** Ensure network connectivity is stable during firmware updates.

### Step 4: Intune Enrollment (Optional)

If managing with Intune:

1. **Choose enrollment during setup**
   - Some devices prompt for MDM enrollment
   - Or configure in device settings later

2. **Scan enrollment QR code**
   - Generate from Intune (AOSP enrollment profile)
   - Scan with device camera

3. **Complete enrollment**
   - Device downloads management profile
   - Applies configuration policies

See [Android AOSP](../04-intune-management/android-aosp.md) for detailed Intune enrollment.

### Step 5: Sign In with Resource Account

1. **Enter resource account**
   - UPN: `mtr-room@contoso.com`
   - Password: Resource account password

2. **Select account type**
   - Microsoft 365 / Office 365

3. **Complete sign-in**
   - May require accepting permissions
   - Calendar syncs

4. **Verify sign-in**
   - Calendar appears on display
   - Room name shows correctly

### Step 6: Configure Device Settings

Access settings via touch controller:

1. **Tap More (...)**
2. **Select Settings**
3. **Enter admin password**
   - Default varies by vendor
   - Change default password

**Configure:**

| Setting | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| Room name | Verify matches resource account |
| Theme | Per branding requirements |
| Default camera settings | Auto-frame, zoom, etc. |
| Audio settings | Volume, noise suppression |
| Display settings | Brightness, timeout |
| Bluetooth | Enable for proximity join |

### Step 7: Configure Peripherals (If Applicable)

For modular systems with additional peripherals:

1. **Extension microphones**
   - Position in room
   - Verify recognition in settings

2. **Additional cameras**
   - Connect and position
   - Configure as needed

3. **External speakers**
   - Connect and configure
   - Test audio levels
