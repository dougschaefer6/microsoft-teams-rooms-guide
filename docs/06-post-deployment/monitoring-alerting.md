## Azure Monitor Integration

### Setting Up Azure Monitor

For advanced monitoring, use Azure Monitor:

1. **Create Log Analytics Workspace**
   ```powershell
   New-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "MTR-Monitoring" `
       -Name "MTR-LogAnalytics" `
       -Location "EastUS"
   ```

2. **Configure Diagnostic Settings**
   - Enable audit logs from Entra ID
   - Stream sign-in logs
   - Configure Intune diagnostics

3. **Create Alert Rules**
   ```
   Alert name: MTR Sign-in Failures
   Scope: Log Analytics workspace
   Condition: SigninLogs | where UserPrincipalName startswith "mtr-" and ResultType != "0"
   Action: Send email to support team
   ```

### Sample KQL Queries

**MTR Sign-in Failures:**
```kusto
SigninLogs
| where UserPrincipalName startswith "mtr-"
| where ResultType != "0"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, ResultType, ResultDescription, IPAddress
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

**MTR Device Activity:**
```kusto
