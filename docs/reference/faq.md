### What is Microsoft Teams Rooms?

Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTR) is a complete meeting solution that brings the Teams experience to conference rooms. It consists of certified hardware running dedicated software optimized for meeting room scenarios.

### What's the difference between Teams Rooms on Windows and Android?

**Windows MTR:**
- More advanced features (Front Row, content camera, intelligent speakers)
- Higher compute requirements and cost
- Managed via Intune with Autopilot support
- More peripheral options

**Android MTR:**
- Lower cost entry point
- All-in-one form factors available
- Simpler deployment
- Managed via vendor platforms or Intune AOSP

### Do I need Teams Rooms Pro or Basic?

**Choose Basic if:**
- You have 25 or fewer rooms
- You don't need advanced monitoring
- Budget is primary concern
- Basic management is sufficient

**Choose Pro if:**
- You have more than 25 rooms
- You need remote management and monitoring
- You want advanced analytics
- You need professional support

## Licensing Questions

### What license does the room resource account need?

Each Teams Rooms device needs either:
- Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro (full features)
- Microsoft Teams Rooms Basic (limited, max 25 per tenant)

The license is assigned to the resource account, not the device.

### Does each room need its own license?

Yes, each resource account (room) requires its own Teams Rooms license. One license per room.

### Can I use a regular Microsoft 365 license for Teams Rooms?

No. Regular user licenses (E3, E5, Business) are not supported for Teams Rooms. You must use the dedicated Teams Rooms Pro or Basic license.

### Do Teams Panels need separate licenses?

Teams Panels can use a Shared Device license or share the license with a paired Teams Room. Check current licensing guidance as this may change.

## Account Questions

### Why do I need a resource account?

The resource account:
- Represents the room in Exchange (for calendar)
- Provides identity for Teams sign-in
- Shows the room's availability
- Enables meeting invitations

### Should the password expire on resource accounts?

No. Set passwords to never expire for resource accounts. Interactive password change is not possible on MTR devices.

### Can I use synced AD accounts for MTR?

Cloud-only accounts are recommended. Synced accounts can work but may have complications with password management and authentication.

### How do I change the resource account password?

1. Reset password in Entra ID or Microsoft 365 Admin Center
2. Update password on the device settings
3. Verify sign-in works

## Security Questions

### Why can't I require MFA for Teams Rooms?

MTR devices operate as unattended kiosks. They cannot:
- Display MFA prompts
- Accept push notifications
- Enter verification codes

Use device compliance and trusted locations instead.

### Is Teams Rooms secure without MFA?

Yes, when properly configured:
- Device compliance ensures managed device
- Trusted locations restrict where sign-in works
- Passwords are strong and non-expiring
- Conditional Access controls access

### Should I enable BitLocker on Windows MTR?

Yes. BitLocker protects data if the device is stolen. It's supported and recommended for compliance policies.

### Can I install antivirus on MTR?

Windows MTR includes Microsoft Defender by default. It's recommended to keep it enabled. Third-party antivirus may cause compatibility issues.

## Deployment Questions

### How do I deploy Teams Rooms at scale?

For Windows MTR:
1. Use Windows Autopilot with self-deploying mode
2. Configure Autologin for automatic sign-in
3. Pre-register devices with vendors
4. Use dynamic groups for consistent policy application

### What's the best deployment method?

**Recommended:** Autopilot + Autologin (Windows)
- Zero-touch deployment
- Consistent configuration
- Scalable
- No manual device setup needed

### How long does deployment take per device?

| Method | Time |
|--------|------|
| Autopilot + Autologin | 25-45 minutes |
| Manual deployment | 45-90 minutes |

### Do I need to be on-site to deploy?

With Autopilot: No. Device configures itself.
With manual: Yes, someone needs to complete setup.

## Network Questions

### What ports does Teams Rooms need?

Essential ports:
- TCP 80, 443 (HTTP/HTTPS)
- UDP 3478-3481 (STUN/TURN)
