## Summary: What NOT to Configure

### Do Not Apply to MTR Accounts/Devices

1. **Interactive MFA** - Cannot complete prompts
2. **Password policies** - Breaks kiosk operation
3. **Terms of use** - No interactive acceptance
4. **Password change requirements** - No interactive capability
5. **Sign-in risk blocking** (strict) - May cause issues

### Always Exclude MTR From

- User-targeted MFA policies
- Standard device compliance (use MTR-specific)
- User password policies
- Self-service password reset requirements
- Interactive Conditional Access challenges

## Best Practices

1. **Create dedicated MTR policies** rather than modifying user policies
2. **Use security groups** for consistent exclusions
3. **Test in report-only** before enabling policies
4. **Document all policy decisions** for compliance
5. **Review regularly** as Microsoft adds features
